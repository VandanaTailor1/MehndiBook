This project is a simple form integrated with Firebase for data storage 
and location tracking using latitude and longitude. To set up, clone the repository, 
install dependencies, and configure Firebase. Users can submit data through the form, and the app displays 
location based on provided coordinates. See the README for detailed instructions and contributions.
